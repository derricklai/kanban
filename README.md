***Kanban*** Kanban is a full-stack productivity app for simple task management. It uses a visual board system for project planning, inspired by Toyota's method. The front-end uses NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Redux for responsive UI and state management, with drag-and-drop functionality. The back-end uses MongoDB for data storage, with NextJS API routes and React-Query for efficient data handling and real-time updates.
